lets look at some boxplots

```

data("ToothGrowth")

```

lets change the dose to a factor, and look at teh top of the dataframe

```

ToothGrowth$as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)

head(ToothGrowth, 4)

```

lets load ggplot

```

library(ggplot2)

```

lets set the theme for our plots to classic

```

theme_set(
  theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "top")

)

```

lets start with a very basic boxplot with dose vs length

```

tg <-ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len))
tg + geom_boxplot()

```

now lets look at a boxplot with points for the mean

```

tg + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, fill = "lightgrey") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 2.5, color = "indianred")

```

```
tg + geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("0.5", "2"))

```

lets put our x acxis in descending order

```

tg + geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("2", "1", "0.5"))

```

we can also change boxplot colors by groups

```

tg + geom_boxplot(aes(color = dose)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("indianred", "blue1", "green2"))

```

what if we want to display our data subset by oj vs vitamin c?

```

tg2 <- tg + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp), position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#999999", "#E69F19"))

tg2

```

we can also arrange this as two plots with facet_wrap

```

tg2 + facet_wrap(~supp)

```
