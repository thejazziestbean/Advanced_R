first lets load our required package

```

library(plotly)

```

lets start with a scatter plot of the orange dataset

```

Orange <- as.data.frame(Orange)

plot_ly(data = Orange, x = ~age, y = ~circumference)

```

now lets add some more info

```

plot_ly(data = Orange, x = ~age, y = ~circumference,
        color = ~Tree, size = ~age,
        text = ~paste("Tree ID:", Tree, "<br>Age:", age, "Circ:", circumference)
)

```

now lets create a random distribution and add it to our dataframe

```
trace_1 <- rnorm(35, mean = 120, sd = 10)
new_data <- data.frame(Orange, trace_1)

```

we'll use the random numbers as lines on the graph

```

plot_ly(data = new_data, x = ~age, y = ~circumference, color = ~Tree, size = ~age,
        text = ~paste("Tree ID:", Tree, "<br>Circ:", circumference)) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~trace_1, mode = 'lines') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~circumference, mode = 'markers')

```

now lets create a graph with the option of showing as a scatter or line, and add labels.
