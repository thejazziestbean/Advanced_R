what if we want to know what our outliers are?

first we need to load the required libraries

```

library(outliers)
library(ggplot2)

```

and reloud the dataser because we removed outliers

```
library(readxl)
Air_data <- read_xlsx("AirQualityUCI.xlsx")

```

- ----------------------------------- continuing on for when code gets fixed

lets create a function using the grubbb test to identidy all outliers.

the grubbs test identifies outliers in a univariable dataset that is presumed to come from a normal distribution.

```

grubbs.flag <- function(x) {
  #lets create a variable called outliers and save nothing in it, we'll add to the variable as we identify them

  outliers <- NULL

  #we'll create a variable called test to identify which univariate we are testing

  test <- x

  #now using the outliers package, use grubbs test to find outliers in our variable

  grubbs.result <- grubbs.test(test)

  #lets get the p-values of all tested variables

  pv <- grubbs.result$p.value

  #now lets search through our p-values for ones that are outside of 0.5
  while(pv < 0.05) {

    # anything with a pvalues greater than p = 0.05, we add to our empty outliers vector
    outliers <- c(outliers, as.numeric(strsplit(grubbs.result$alternative, "")[1][3]))

   #now we want to remove those outliers from our test variable

    test <- x[!x %in% outliers]

  #and run the grubbs test again without the outliers

    grubbs.result <- grubbs.test(test)

  #and save the new pvalues

    pv <- grubbs.results$p.value

  }

return(data.frame(x=x, Outliers = (x %in% outliers)))

}

```

```

identified_outliers <- grubbs.test(Air_data$AH)

```

now we can create a histogram showing where the outliers were
